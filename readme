('In-Advance' is initially named as 'ProDataR' when I first started the development)
To use the ProDataR,follow the steps as below:
1. Prerequisites
mpi, pnetcdf, libevent, libmemcached, memcached, pthread, all in your home dir

Note: on hrothgar, mpi is already installed, use which mpicc to find the mpi install
director, then install the pnetcdf with that directory. libmemcached is based on 
libevent and is a client interface of memcached. pthread is usually already there.

2. Export library path 

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/jialliu/libmemcached/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/jialliu/pnetcdf/lib
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:/home/jialliu/libmemcached/include
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:/home/jialliu/pnetcdf/include

Note: change the path; /home/jialliu/ into your own directory

3. Start a database server, or start multiple servers

3.1 login into a compute node
qlogin -q normal -pe fill 12 -P hrothgar

Note: first ssh to hrothgar headnode, then use qlogin acquire a compute node

3.2 run a memcached server, with 1024m memory, i.e., 1G 
./memcached  -d -m 1024 -u root -l localhost  -p 11211
or
./memcached  -d -m 1024 -u root -l <ipaddress of the node>  -p 11211

Note: after acquiring a compute node, that node is only for database server,
start a new terminal and do other things.

4. Compile proDataR

cd to /src/prodatar
make clean
make

5. Run proDataR

cd to /src/prodatar
write some sample data: qsub p-hro-w.sh
read data: qsub p-hro-r.sh
